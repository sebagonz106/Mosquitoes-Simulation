# Checkpoint Directory

This directory stores simulation checkpoints in JSON format.

Checkpoints are automatically generated after each simulation with descriptive names:
- `checkpoint_{species}_{days}days_{timestamp}.json`
- `checkpoint_{scenario}_{days}days_{timestamp}.json`

Users can load these checkpoints to review previous simulation results.
